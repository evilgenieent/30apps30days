# This is my 30 apps in 30 days project.


## What is this project?

Each day I will attempt to make one React webapp.
Wish me luck! 🍀

I used these resources to get me started with React:

- [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/)'s JavaScript exercises
- [exercism](http://exercism.io/)
- [React Documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
- [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)


** The project is hosted at [th1rty.herokuapp.com](https://th1rty.herokuapp.com/). **


🎨 The art is made with:

- Watercolours
- [Piskel Sprite Editor](http://www.piskelapp.com/) to create the digital art and gifs.
- CSS.
