<b>This is my 30 apps in 30 days project. I am using React JS.</b>

What is this project?

Each day I will attempt to make one React webapp.

I used these resources to get me started with React:
- [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/)'s JavaScript exercises
- [exercism](http://exercism.io/)
- [React Documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/)


<b>The project is hosted at [th1rty.herokuapp.com](https://th1rty.herokuapp.com/).</b>

Wish me luck! 🍀


🎨 <b>For the artwork, I use:</b>
- my own watercolour paintings
- [Piskel Sprite Editor](http://www.piskelapp.com/) to create the digital art and gifs.

<b>Day 1: Collect Pocky 😋</b>


<b>Day 2: Escape the Labyrinth/Save Toby 👶</b>


<b>Day 3: Dice 🎲</b>
- Used every-dice npm package https://www.npmjs.com/package/every-dice


<b>Day 4: Pepper 🤖</b>
- Uses alerts.

<b>Day 5: Good Egg 🥚</b>
- Used CSS to make the virtual pet.
- Uses a switch case for the cat's emotions.
